- **Files**: Use PascalCase for docs (e.g., `README.md`)
- **Code**: Follow language conventions

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add pirate theme references for consistency 🏴‍☠️
- Provide links between related documents
- Include prerequisites and setup instructions

## Demo Quality Checklist

## Tips for Great Demos

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a clear, achievable goal
2. **Show MCP Integration**: Demonstrate at least one MCP tool
3. **Document Everything**: Record all prompts and outcomes
4. **Make it Visual**: Include screenshots or recordings
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Run through the demo multiple times
6. **Keep it Focused**: One main concept per demo
7. **Add Personality**: Use themes or creative elements

## Example Prompts

Good examples of Agent Mode prompts:

```
Create a [project type] that demonstrates [feature/capability] using [technology]
```

```
Build a [application] with [requirements], including tests and documentation
```

```
Implement [feature] following [standards/best practices]
```
