## Calculator Demo - Spec-Kit Commands

### 1. Constitution Phase
```
/speckit.constitution Create a constitution for a modern web-based calculator application that emphasizes user experience, accessibility, and clean code architecture. The calculator should be simple yet powerful, supporting basic arithmetic operations with a clean, intuitive interface.
```

### 2. Specification Phase
```
/speckit.specify Build a web-based calculator with the following requirements: Support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), include memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC), provide keyboard shortcuts for all operations, implement a clear/all-clear function, display calculation history, ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop, follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, and use modern vanilla JavaScript without dependencies.
```

### 3. Planning Phase
```
/speckit.plan Create a detailed implementation plan for the calculator application, breaking down the work into logical phases covering HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript logic, keyboard event handling, memory functions, history tracking, accessibility features, and testing strategy.
```

### 4. Implementation Phase
```
/speckit.implement Execute the implementation plan for the calculator application, creating all necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), implementing core calculation logic, adding keyboard support, implementing memory functions, building the history feature, ensuring accessibility compliance, and adding comprehensive inline documentation.
```

## Full Workflow

1. Go to the project folder
2. Start using slash commands with your AI agent:
   - 2.1 `/speckit.constitution` - Establish project principles
   - 2.2 `/speckit.specify` - Create baseline specification
   - 2.3 `/speckit.plan` - Create implementation plan
   - 2.4 `/speckit.tasks` - Generate actionable tasks
   - 2.5 `/speckit.implement` - Execute implementation
